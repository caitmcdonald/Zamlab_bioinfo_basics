##### Downloading and installing software

Install software:

    sudo apt-get install <software_name>

<br>

Femove software:

    sudo apt-get --purge remove <software_name>

<br>

Update one application only:

    sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install <software_name>

<br>

Retrieve web content:

    curl -o "url[range]" -o <outputfile_#1.txt> 

(You can include range or list of elements with \[\] for sequential or {} if not)

<br>

##### Navigating directories

See command line history:

    history

<br>

##### Viewing directories

Files in a directory, human-readable:

    ls -lh

<br>

Size of current directory (BioHPC):

    lfs-du -h .

<br>

Size of files in directory, sorted by size (BioHPC):

    lfs-du -h $DIR/* | sort -hr

<br>

##### Viewing files

View a file in terminal (only loads a portion of file in memory at a time):

    less <filename>

<br>

Create and edit a file within terminal:

    nano <filename>

<br>

Open a file in your default editor:

    edit <filename>

<br>

##### Viewing program progress

View all programs you have running:

    top -u <username>

<br>

View output file as it's being written:

    tail -f <filename>

<br>
