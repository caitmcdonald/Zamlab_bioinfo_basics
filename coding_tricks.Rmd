##### Downloading and installing software #####

Install software:
```
sudo apt-get install <software_name>
```
<br>


Femove software:
```
sudo apt-get --purge remove <software_name>
```
<br>

Update one application only:
```
sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install <software_name>
```
<br>

Retrieve web content:
```
curl -o "url[range]" -o <outputfile_#1.txt> 
```
(You can include range or list of elements with [] for sequential or {} if not)

<br>

##### Navigating directories #####

See command line history:
```
history
```
<br>


##### Viewing directories #####

Files in a directory, human-readable:
```
ls -lh
```
<br>

Size of current directory (BioHPC):
```
lfs-du -h .
```
<br>

Size of files in directory, sorted by size (BioHPC):
```
lfs-du -h $DIR/* | sort -hr
```
<br>


##### Viewing files #####

View a file in terminal (only loads a portion of file in memory at a time):
```
less <filename>
```
<br>

Create and edit a file within terminal:
```
nano <filename>
```
<br>

Open a file in your default editor:
```
edit <filename>
```
<br>


##### Viewing program progress #####

View all programs you have running:
```
top -u <username>
```
<br>

View output file as it's being written:
```
tail -f <filename>
```
